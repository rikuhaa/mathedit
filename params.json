The main difference between this plugin and the 'original' CodeCogs plugin is that this plugin aims to integrate more smoothly with CKEditor.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks also to creators of the great CKEditor -plugin tutorials: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Tutorials/Abbr_Plugin_Part_1 and http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Tutorials/Abbr_Plugin_Part_2\r\n\r\nAuthor: Riku Haavisto License: GPL, LGPL and MPL\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# USAGE:\r\n\r\nRequires CKEditor, JQuery and MathQuill\r\n\r\nAdd plugin folder (mathedit) to CKEditor's plugins-folder and add mathedit to CKEditor's config.extraplugins\r\n\r\nThis will add a 'mathedit' button to your CKEditor's toolbar (if you have not limited which buttons are shown) that you can use to open a dialog for editing latex with MathQuill. When click 'ok' on the dialog the edited latex will be rendered to a gif-image by CodeCogs and added to the cursor position in your CKEditor. You can further edit the math-value by right-clicking on it and choosing math-editor from the context-menu or by double-clicking on it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# EXAMPLE:\r\n\r\nA simple test-installation including all the needed dependencies can be found in 'test'-folder. You should be able to run it by simple opening 'test/test.html' in a browser (won't probably open in IE though without little changes).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# TODO:\r\n\r\n    the MathQuill-text field should be styled to stand out more\r\n    integrating a visual latex-toolbar be a good idea\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
